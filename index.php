	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> 200g Spinach </li>
		<li> 50g bunch parsley </li>
		<li> 50g bunch dill </li>
		<li> 75g bunch coriander </li>
		<li> 50g bunch chives </li>
		<li> 5 medium eggs </li>
		<li> half tsp turmeric </li>
		<li> 2 tbsp plain flour </li>
		<li> 1 tsp sea salt </li>
		<li> 1 tsp black pepper </li>

		<li> 2 tsp sunflower oil </li>
		<li> 2 garlic cloves, crushed </li>
	</ul>
	</div>

		<h3> Method </h3>
	<p>Wash the spinach, parsley, dill, coriander and chives, then dry well on kitchen paper or in a salad spinner. Try and squeeze as much moisture out as possible; if the greens are wet when they are cooked, they will make the kuku go spongy. Chop finely or blitz in the food processor, in a couple of batches.Pre-heat the grill to high. Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the turmeric, flour, salt, pepper and fenugreek leaf. Stir in the chopped spinach and herbs.Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the garlic and gently fry over a low heat for 2 minutes to soften.Make sure the garlic and spring onions are evenly distributed around the pan, then pour in the egg mixture. Cook over a low heat for about 5 to 8 minutes, until the kuku is almost cooked through. Finish off under the hot grill.Leave to cool slightly, then cut into triangular slices to serve.</p>
